# Interactive COVID-19 Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive 3D globe built with Three.js that visually represents COVID-19 case data across the world. Explore the pandemic's impact by rotating the Earth and hovering over countries to see detailed figures. This project transforms complex data into an intuitive and engaging geographical experience.

## Features
*   **Immersive 3D Globe:** A beautifully rendered WebGL globe that you can rotate, zoom, and pan for exploration.
*   **Real-time Data Overlay:** Visual representation of COVID-19 cases with color gradients or bar metrics per country.
*   **Interactive Tooltips:** Hover over any country to see its name and total confirmed COVID-19 cases.
*   **Responsive Design:** The globe adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
*   **Clean and Modern UI:** A minimalist interface that focuses attention on the data visualization.
